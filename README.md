# Hi there, I'm Carlos
-----------------------

 I am a front-end developer with previous experience in the restaurant and health care industries.  Throughout my professional life as a business owner and a sales manager, I have learned to plan according to a goal, taking into consideration the needs of different clients to offer specific solutions to the problem they had. Planning accordingly, staying aware of the big picture, and making adjustments to the plan when needed are how I deliver high results while working with a team. Now as a frontend developer, I keep striving for excellence, through curiosity, attention to detail, and a growth mindset.

 I’m hoping to join a team where I’ll have an opportunity to continue growing and be exposed to new challenges. I have a particular passion for optimizing and improving current products, but I’m excited to explore all of the different ways I can help to make things happen. I’m curious by nature, and there’s so much that I still want to learn and see. I’m mostly excited to take the skills I’ve learned and start putting them to use in the tech industry.
 
 I’m particularly proud of the work that I did on this project on this project Rancid Tomatillos (a new experience for our group that wasn’t taught or expected), and believe this pull [request](https://github.com/karmacarlos/rancid-tomatillos/pull/19) shows the care with which I work with teammates when we have different ideas about how to push our project forward.
