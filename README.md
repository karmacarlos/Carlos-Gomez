# Hi there, I'm Carlos
-----------------------
I am a front-end developer with previous experience as a small business owner and sales manager. I always maintain a big picture view while remaining flexible to adjust the course when needed.

I am passionate about the client experience. I approach my work through the lens of the end user and strategize to provide the best user experience. My love for creative problem solving and delivering precise and customized solutions have brought me to this exciting career path. As a front-end developer, I strive for excellence through curiosity, attention to detail, and a growth mindset.

 I’m hoping to join a team where I’ll have an opportunity to continue growing and be exposed to new challenges. I have a particular passion for optimizing and improving current products, but I’m excited to explore all of the different ways I can help to make things happen. I’m curious by nature, and there’s so much that I still want to learn and see. I’m mostly excited to take the skills I’ve learned and start putting them to use in the tech industry.
 
 I’m particularly proud of the work I did on this project, even when Vainilla JS technology is not very used a lot these days because of the challenges of handling the dom and keeping the state updated throughout the whole application, I had a lot of fun creating this app, it's a hotel booking manager, [here](https://github.com/karmacarlos/overlook-2021) you can see the repo and play with the deployed [app](https://karmacarlos.github.io/overlook-2021/).
