- Hi, I am a current student from the Turing School of Software & Designâ€™s Front-End Engineering Program. I have previous experience in the restaurant and sales industry, and while that might not immediately seem like the most relevant thing to mention, it gave me the skills to work on a team to solve problems in high pressure situations.

- Iâ€™m hoping to join a team where Iâ€™ll have an opportunity to continue growing and be exposed to new things. I have a particular passion for optimizing and improving current products, but Iâ€™m excited to explore all of the different ways I can help to make that happen. Iâ€™m a naturally curious person, and thereâ€™s so much in the tech world that I havenâ€™t seen yet. Iâ€™m mostly excited to take the skills Iâ€™ve learned and start putting them to use.
 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning javaScript.
